# ART-i-FIT

Art-i-Fit aims to motivate youth to get outside, work out, or go for a simple walk while creating beautiful art that they can keep or sell. Our platform blends sports activity with on-chain activity, gamifying, beautifying, and tokenizing walking.

With Art-i-Fit, you can mint your walking steps in an artistic way, creating one-of-a-kind pieces of artwork with every step you take.


## Deployment
We are using Wanchain's cross-chain message passing SDK to seamlessly connect our decentralized application with the Wanchain L1 blockchain and other EVM-compatible blockchains, enabling secure and efficient data transfer and transactions across multiple networks.
